## What does this do?
It creates the react-redux folder structure that I found:
  - Relatively easier to work with
  - Easy to scale

## How to use this?
  - Setup your react app using your preferred method like create-react-app
  - run `npx create-react-redux-folders <path/to/src>`

## Work in progress
  - [ ] Typescript types
  - [ ] Testing

## This may be useless
You may want to structure your folders yourself
